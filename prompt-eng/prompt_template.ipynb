    "# Prompt Template Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Template Prompting refers to a technique where predefined templates are used to construct effective prompts that guide large language models (LLMs) to generate responses tailored to specific use cases. The templates typically contain static text combined with dynamic input variables, allowing for consistent, reusable, and customizable prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt templates are widely used across various domains, such as:\n",
    "* **Question Generation**: Templates can generate quiz questions by filling in variables related to topics.\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Static instructions combined with variable documents or inputs allow flexible summarization.\n",
    "* **Coding Assistance**: Dynamic prompts help LLMs generate code snippets for different programming tasks.\n",

      "**Introduction**\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "\n",
      "This document outlines the requirements for a new application project, including key functionalities, non-functional requirements, user stories, system components, and constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Functionalities**\n",
      "---------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The following are the primary functionalities required for the application:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **User Registration**: Users can register with their username and password.\n",
      "*   **Login**: Users can log in using their registered credentials.\n",
      "*   **Profile Management**: Users can view, edit, and update their profile information.\n",
      "*   **Task Management**: Users can create, view, edit, and delete tasks assigned to them by the system administrators.\n",
      "*   **Communication**: Users can send messages to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Non-Functional Requirements**\n",
      "-------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The following are the non-functional requirements for the application:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Security**: The application should be secure against unauthorized access and data breaches. It should implement adequate measures such as encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.\n",
      "*   **Usability**: The application should be user-friendly and easy to use. It should provide clear instructions and intuitive interfaces.\n",
      "*   **Performance**: The application should respond quickly to user inputs and handle large volumes of data efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "**System Design**\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The system design consists of the following components:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Frontend**: The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system.\n",
      "*   **Backend**: The backend is built using Python and Django. It handles data storage, retrieval, and processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Database Design**\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The database design consists of three tables:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Users Table**: This table stores information about registered users. Each row in this table represents a user.\n",
      "*   **Tasks Table**: This table stores information about tasks assigned to users. Each row in this table represents a task.\n",
      "*   **Comments Table**: This table stores comments made by users on tasks. Each row in this table represents a comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The database design is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Column Name | Data Type | Description |\n",
